# Xcode-Markdown-Renderer


This is easier than you think: 

1) just type 

     touch myProject.xcodeproj/.xcodesamplecode.plist


1.1) and if you have a workspace:

     touch myProject.xcworkspace/.xcodesamplecode.plist

The only thing is that you won't be avable to edit the markdown file inside xcode...use another markdown editor and done!
