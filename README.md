# Xcode-Markdown-Renderer


This is easier than you think, clone this project and:

1) just type your file project name adding the plist

       touch myProject.xcodeproj/.xcodesamplecode.plist

   1.1) and if you have a workspace:

       touch myProject.xcworkspace/.xcodesamplecode.plist

The only thing is that you won't be avable to edit the markdown file inside xcode...use another markdown editor and done!
